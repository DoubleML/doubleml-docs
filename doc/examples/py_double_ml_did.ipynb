    "In this example, we illustrate how the [DoubleML](https://docs.doubleml.org/stable/index.html) package can be used to estimate the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) under the conditional parallel trend assumption. The estimation is based on [Chang (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1093/ectj/utaa001), [Sant'Anna and Zhao (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2020.06.003) and [Zimmert et al.

    "Using the potential outcome notation, we can write $Y_{it}(d)$ for the potential outcome of unit $i$ at time $t$ and treatment status $d$. Further, let $X_i$ denote a vector of pre-treatment covariates.\n",
