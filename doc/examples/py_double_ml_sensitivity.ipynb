To additionally incorporate statistical uncertainty, a significance level (default $0.95$) is used.\n",

The robustness value $RV$ is defined as the required confounding strength (`cf_y=rv` and `cf_d=rv`), such that the lower or upper bound of the causal parameter includes the null hypothesis. The robustness value $RVa$ defined analogous but additionally incorporates statistical uncertainty (as it is based on the confidence intervals of the bounds). For a more detailed explanation\n",
