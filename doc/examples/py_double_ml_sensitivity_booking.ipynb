    "### 3. Sensitivity Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "To address the concerns with regard to the confounding bias, sensitivity analysis has been employed. The literature has developed various approaches, which differ in terms of their applicability to the specific estimation approach (among others). In the context of the use case, the approaches of [VanderWeele and Arah (2011)](https://doi.org/10.1097%2FEDE.0b013e3181f74493) and [Chernozhukov et al. (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13398) have been employed. Here, we won't go into the details of the methods but rather illustrate the application of the sensitivity analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "[VanderWeele and Arah (2011)](https://doi.org/10.1097%2FEDE.0b013e3181f74493) provide a general formula for the omitted variable bias that is applicable irrespective of the estimation framework. The general formula is based on explicit parametrization of the model in terms of the distribution of the unobserved confounder. Such a specification might be difficult to achieve in practice. Hence, the authors also offer a simplified version that employs additional assumptions. For the ATT, these assumptions impose a binary confounding variable that has an effect on $D$ and $Y$ which does not vary with the observed confounding variables. Under these scenarios, the bias formula arises as\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\theta_s - \\theta_0 = \\delta \\cdot \\gamma\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $\\theta_s$ refers to the short parameter (= the ATT that is identfiable from the available data, i.e., under unobserved confounding) and $\\theta_0$ the long or true parameter (that would be identifiable if the unobserved confounder was observed). $\\delta$ and $\\gamma$ denote the sensitivity parameters in this framework and refer to difference in the prevalence of the (binary) confounder in the treated and the untreated group (after accounting for $X$): $\\delta = P(U|D=1, X) - P(U|D=0,X)$. $\\gamma$ refers to the confounding effect in the main equation, i.e., $\\gamma = E[Y|D,X, U=1] - E[Y|D,X, U=0]$, which describes the average expected difference in the outcome variable due to a change in the confounding variable $U$ (given $D$ and $X$). For a more detailed treatment, we refer to the original paper by [VanderWeele and Arah (2011)](https://doi.org/10.1097%2FEDE.0b013e3181f74493). This sensitivity approach is appealing because of its simplicity and applicability. We can specify various scenarios in terms of values for $\\gamma$ and $\\delta$ and compute the bias. This could also be illustrated in a contour plot.\n",

    "### 4. Benchmarking Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Benchmarking helps to bridge the gap between the hypothetical values for the sensitivity parameters and the empirical relationships in the data. The idea of benchmarking is as follows: We can leave out one of the observed confounders and then re-compute the values for the sensitivity parameters. \n",

    "#### VanderWeele and Arah (2011): Benchmarking\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to obtain benchmarking values for $\\gamma$ and $\\delta$, would be to transform one of the candidate variables into a dummy variable (if it was not binary before). This type of benchmarking analysis is not presented in the original paper by [VanderWeele and Arah (2011)](https://doi.org/10.1097%2FEDE.0b013e3181f74493) and is mainly motivated by practical considerations. We can compute the average difference in the prevalence of the binary version of $X_2$ in the group of treated and untreated, i.e, $\\delta^* = P(X_2|D=1, X_{-2}) - P(X_2|D=0,X_{-2})$ and $\\gamma^* = E[Y|D,X_{-2}, X_2=1] - E[Y|D,X_{-2}, X_2=0]$, where $X_{-2}$ indicates all observed confounders except for $X_2$. To keep it simple, we focus on linear models for estimation of the conditional probabilities and expectations. As a rough approximation we can obtain a benchmark value for $\\gamma^*$ from a linear regression of the outcome variable on the covariates and the treatment variables. There are basically several approaches to approach the benchmark quantities here."

    "We can conclude that the ATT would not be robust to the benchmarking scenario based on $X_1$: A confounder that would be comparable in terms of the explanatory power for the outcome and the treatment variable to the observed confounder $X_1$ would be sufficient to switch the sign of the ATT estimate. This is different for the less pessimistic scenario based on $X_2$. Here, the ATT is robust to the benchmarking scenario. This is in line with the overall intuition in the business case under consideration."

    "In this notebook, we presented a simplified example of a sensitivity analysis for a causal effect inspired by a use case at Booking.com. Sensitivity analysis is intended to quantify the strength of an ommited (confounding) variable bias, which is inherently based on untestable identification assumptions. Hence, the results from a applying sensitivity analysis will generally not be unambiguous (as for example from common statistical test procedures) and have to be considered in the context of the use case. Hence, the integration of use-case-related expertise is essential to interpret the results of a sensitivity analysis, specifically regarding the plausibility of the assumed confounding scenarios."
