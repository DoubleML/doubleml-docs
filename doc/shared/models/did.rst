**Difference-in-Differences Models (DID)** implmented in the package focus on the the binary treatmet case with
with two treatment periods.

Adopting the notation from `Sant'Anna and Zhao (2020) <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2020.06.003>`_, 
let :math:`Y_{it}` be the outcome of interest for unit :math:`i` at time :math:`t`. Further, let :math:`D_{it}=1` indicate 
if unit :math:`i` is treated before time :math:`t` (otherwise :math:`D_{it}=0`).
